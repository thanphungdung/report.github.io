                            Until now, we have done a prototype of our project which included basic functionalities. We created a UI that users can interact with. For example, from our homepage, if you want to see our products, you can click on the product icon and it will link you to the product page. Our project, when completely developed, can contribute a huge impact on restricting the environmental crisis. It is because our website raises awareness of people by posting daily environment-related newsletters, and reports. As well as selling environmentally friendly products such as bamboo straws, tote bags, reusable snack bags, etc. Unfortunately, as we mentioned, it is for now just a prototype of our project, it is still in the early stage and in development. Thus, you cannot use it right away. For example, when you click on one of the products, it’s supposed to move you to a product description page. However, we, unfortunately, don’t have enough time and experience to add that function yet. Our website doesn’t seem to have any bugs for now. However, we understand that in further development, having bugs is inevitable. Then, it is our job to fix those bugs and continue to develop the website. Right now, our website is pretty limited in terms of functionality as we are first-year university students and don’t have the experience to develop more complicated functions. There are lots of things that we are planning to improve in the future. Firstly, we are planning to improve the UI, the current UI is too basic and primitive. We want it to look more professional and appealing. Secondly, we want to add the discussion forum that users can discuss and talk about environment-related topics as well as giving us feedback about our products. Lastly, we would like to finish the product feature so that users can actually buy products from the website
