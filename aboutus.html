                    <p>Interest in the topic: The environment is the problem we are facing nowadays, I believe everyone needs to act to solve this problem together. As a developer, creating a web to raise awareness and show solutions to save the environment is the best way to contribute to it.
                        <br>
                        Role: My role in the project mostly focuses on creating and operating the website which is our final product. Act as a teacher then assist members on learning the language for web development. Plan and create timetables, assigning roles and mapped out the direction of the website for the whole team so we can work efficiently. Team Leader.
                        <br>
                        Personality: Dung is a friendly person with high responsibility. In my opinion, the leader is the most suitable position for him because in this project he usually manages and reminds deadlines, and divides missions for other team members. He also has a strong connection with everyone on the team. However, sometimes he couldn’t use this to fuel himself in daily activities.</p>
