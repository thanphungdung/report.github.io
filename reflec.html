                        <p>
                            Throughout this course, I have been a teammate of two amazing people. I feel lucky that I have the opportunity to be in the team with them. I don’t think I could have done the project this perfectly without them. Initially, when we did the project proposal, I thought we would never be able to do a project demo with that idea. However, at last,  I think I underestimated myself and my teammates. We were able to finish the project demo before the deadline of the presentation so that people can have a better understanding of our project. Obviously, it’s still a project demo, there are still lots of things to improve. Unfortunately, with the given time, this is the best we can do for now. If we had the chance, we would finish the features such as creating a discussion forum. I am surprised by the fact that we actually created a website by ourselves. Thinking about it, before this project, I had no knowledge of HTML and programming in general, and suddenly, out of nowhere, the task was to create a website. However, with the help from my teammates now I know the basic concepts of building a website and have a better view of the IT industry.

                        Personally, this project was very stressful for me, throughout the process of the project it felt as if we needed to improve and I could not contribute a lot to our group. It felt overwhelming for me especially at the beginning when the assignment was given. It felt as if the assignment was such a massive hurdle for me and I became extremely unmotivated and worried. However, I was surprised that everything came out to be just fine. It is surprising that I have it in me to motivate my teammates, contribute to brainstorming and bring it to our website and even write this report in a short timeframe. Many times, our group felt extremely disconnected from one another; we fell into complete chaos because we were all extremely worried about the outcome of the project. Yet, we all overcome it. If I could go back in time, all I really wished could be different was that we understand this sooner and communicate with each other more because when we communicate is when we have found the light at the end of the tunnel. I learnt that a group without communication is just a team with many individuals.

                    <p>In week 11, we have an assignment that requires us to think about the IT project. So the range of this project is nearly limitless. After discussing with the whole team, we decided to create a project called CycleIT, which is a combination of education and e-commercial website where we want to not only raise awareness of people about the environment but also funding for organizations that have the same purpose. Our motivation behind this project is when doing some research and reading intensively, we found so many useful things that can help the environment and we want to bring this for as many people as possible.
                        First, my job is to create a prototype so that at the presentation everyone would have a closer look at how our website is gonna look like. Fortunately, the whole presentation worked pretty well, and after that, we will have a report assignment. Apart from personal sections like team profile, self reflection, I also contribute to the tools and group reflection part. Finally, I was also assigned to create a report website and public it through GitHub. In conclusion, I believe all the knowledge and skills that I have gained after doing this project will be useful in my career future.

                        In week 11, we have an assignment that requires us to think about the IT project. So the range of this project is nearly limitless. After discussing with the whole team, we decided to create a project called CycleIT, a combination of education and e-commercial website where we want to raise awareness of people about the environment and fund organizations that have the same purpose. But why the environment? This topic is not new but never gets old. We believe that everyone understands that the climate has continued to deteriorate due to human interventions. People might argue that debating and raising awareness about the different forms of pollution is rather dull and not innovative, however, we stand firm that we can contribute a new perspective to the table and create opportunities for the environmental crisis via CycleIT. Our motivation behind this project is when doing some research and reading intensively, we found so many valuable things that can help the environment and we want to bring this to as many people as possible.
	Like another project, at the initial stage, we will have a bunch of meetings to discuss the project topic and divide missions for each member of the team. We also created a timetable which was included in the Project Proposal so everyone will know what they have to do weekly. Of course, after 2 or 3 days we would have a standup meeting to update the situation with the team and see if anyone had a roadblock during the project or not. We found this was really helpful for everyone to understand how the project is going on. Hiep was assigned to write the project description which was the main part of our report while Quan had the responsibility to describe project outcomes and skills and jobs. The final member Dung was assigned to do the prototype website, and the report website and also write tools and the group reflection part. Doing such a huge amount of work on this project with two other courses was a challenge for all of us, however dividing the mission at the very early stage really helped us to keep track with the timeline of the project. Each member faced a lot of challenges during their own mission, however by sharing with other members, the whole team found a way together to solve each member's problem which not only supports the project but also give us a chance to improve our communication and working as a team skills.
