                            If we have the opportunity to be funded and further develop our project, we will need more human resources in order to do that. Different people with different particular positions would be highly recommended. We will be hiring the following positions:
                        </p>
                        <h4>Blogger</h4> 
                        <p>As mentioned earlier, our website is educational and e-commercial. This position will be in charge of the ‘educational’ part of the website. Specifically, he will write daily articles, reports, and newsletters about the environment. The requirements for this position are not too strict, you only need to speak English fluently and have good writing skills. The task is easy but the person has to put real effort into it as it requires quite a lot of time</p>
                        <h4> Customer service representative</h4>
                        <p>
                            This position will be the one that contacts and responds to the customers. This position is responsible for maintaining a good relationship with old customers as well as creating a good impression for new customers. Furthermore, this position has to give feedback from customers to other positions. In short, this position acts as a bridge to connect the customers and the developing team. The only requirement for this position is to have good communication skills and be friendly to customers
                        </p>
                        <h4>Product manager</h4>
                        
                        <p>About the ‘e-commercial’ part of our website, we have a “Product” page where we sell environment-friendly products. This position will mostly focus on the sources of our products. He will make sure that we have a stable source of product. In case something unwanted happens such as our source suddenly stop supplying, the person will be responsible to find a new source. There are few requirements for this position. Firstly, a business bachelor's degree is highly recommended. If not, then having experience in business is required. Next, good communication skill is key. This position requires a lot of communication between the person and people in the manufacturing company as well as customers. Lastly, being creative helps our website to even offer more products.</p>
                        <h4>Full stack developer</h4>
                        <p>Our website is still in early development. It hasn’t had as many features as we intended to do. Thus we need a professional full-stack developer to further develop the website. There are some requirements for this position to maximize productivity. Firstly, knowing HTML and using it perfectly is required as our website is built mostly based on HTML. Secondly, being familiar with teamwork is crucial. A professional developer must be able to do his tasks well, but also must be productive in a teamwork environment. We would rather hire a developer with no experience but willing to learn in team assignments than an experienced developer who always isolates himself from others.</p>
