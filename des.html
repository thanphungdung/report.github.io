                        <p>
                            The environment still has been one of the most discussed topics in our current age. Humanity has advanced to many heights, however, the price for all these successes is increasingly becoming more costly. In recent years, the current status of the environment can be summarized in one word, it is a “crisis”. A damaged environment has proved itself to become a major problem that is affecting the lives of many people. Our country Vietnam’s AQI (Air Quality Index) is at an alarming rate, up to 170. It impacts your heart and may cause a stroke. It also harms your respiratory system, mostly the lungs, and it increases the incidence of asthma. While nearly 70 percent of the world is water, only 2.5 percent is fresh. Many countries in Africa lack access to clean water nowadays. In Ethiopia, almost 60 percent of the population doesn’t have fresh water regularly. Global warming has raised the sea level that destroys homes and wiped islands off the map. We understand that the environment is a hard problem to tackle, however, seeing the world on fire it doesn’t seem so bad for us to attempt to piece the world together; we came up with a website that tries to raise awareness for people around the world, connect and build a community, create a way that people can assist in rebuilding our Earth, we called it CycleIT.

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            CycleIT hopes to increase people’s awareness of the many climate and ecosystem issues, we hope to achieve this by creating a sort of journalism website where the latest information on the environment can be summarized and quickly digested by the readers. Build a community by creating a forum for discussions, and create events (such as beach cleaning) on these forums to attract and allow everyone in the community to bond together. We want to create a type of social media for the environment. CycleIT also hopes to raise funding via our e-commercial channel so we can invest more into planting trees, and technologies that can help clean the environment (the ocean cleanup)... 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            If CycleIT can prove itself to be a success, in the future we may hope to develop it into different mediums, such as an application on your phone. CycleIT can be summarized as a project for the environment that acts as a news website, and social media where people can show us support via donations or through our products. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The idea was based on many mediums, one of them being all of us who are working on the project share an interest in creating websites and building social media platforms. We can say that Facebook, and Instagram, heavily influenced us… We were also interested in tackling the environment because we all wanted to do something about it; seeing headlines and how it is affecting so many lives makes us want to escape this deadlock. Our motivation behind this project is simple. We are young energetic coders who are well aware of the scary issues that are presented in our world. Now people may argue that projects for the environment have been deemed to be failures and that they are rather useless, but we disagree. In recent years, so much more of the spotlight is on the environment, it is being more educated in schools; we must continue to build the foundations for our children, create a home for everybody and take accountability for our actions. That is why to us this project is paramount.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            CycleIT not only aligns with our ideologies and belief systems but also heavily aligns with our professional life. We believe it can play a vital role for our employers to evaluate our abilities in the creation and development of a platform, but CycleIT will be able to reflect part of our characters. Furthermore, it is parallel with the current direction the IT industry is heading as well as political trends. With the rise of TikTok as well as the recent pandemic social media has become a very crucial part of our lives, also there have been significant developments in building an online market. Political trends are also swaying towards climate control with many protests occurring all over the world to “Save the trees” and with rising environmental activists like Greta Thunberg. Noticing an opportunity was given, we followed this trend to develop CycleIT
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Needless to say, developing CycleIT will be met with many challenges, one of them is building a project on a red ocean market. What does this mean? It means we are building a project on a topic that was done many times before by many others. People have had many ways of developing their businesses to protect the environment. We have many competitors. Some prime examples are #teamtrees.org and #teamseas.org two websites that allow users to donate a dollar to plant a tree or clean a pound of trash in the ocean. Furthermore, we are also competing with big social media companies like Meta. Despite all, we believe we have created our blue ocean environment in this red sea. This is an idea in the environmental field that was never done before, CycleIT is a website that is used to educate people, and allow people to donate or invest as well as a social media platform for users; which our competitors either lack or will only focus on one of the features mentioned above. CycleIT can serve many different purposes for the most environmental enthusiast as well as the general public.

                    <h3>Aims</h3>    
                        <p>
                            CycleIT is an environmental platform built to connect people from all over the world and take actions to give back to our people. Our aim is simple; it is to do just that. We choose this aim because we want to raise awareness and take actions to protect the ecosystem. We understand that alone that is not possible, at the end of the day we are just three teenagers, and the green is a problem that our world leaders are struggling with. However, that doesn’t mean that we are not ambitious, so we decided that the only way to help that is to create influence and bring people together. CycleIT was created to do just that, to create a community of our users whom we all share a common ground with, that is to protect the planet we live in. However, to do just that we have to prioritize three main goals to achieve that aim.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            One of the goals is to construct a user-friendly UI for our users. It is understandable why everyone would want to create a nice looking UI. CycleIT is like the precious child we raised, the face of the group, of course we would want our website to look as visually appealing as possible. However, achieving this goal means that it can improve our user experience. What we meant by this is that, CycleIT is a website designed to offer our services for everyone. From the most environmental enthusiast to the daily users. Our goal is to create a community, educating the people and giving back to mother nature. We can only educate the users if our website is simple to navigate through. We can only build a strong community if people would want to stay on our website. A visually stunning website not only keeps the user's attention span, but it also shows to our users that we care and we are developing CycleIT because it is our passion.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            The second goal is to achieve our aim to educate the people, we can only truly connect people if the people are aware of the current issue that is happening in our planet, showing our users the damages we have caused and that it is time to take accountability. We can achieve this by developing a forum, a form of quick journalism, that with just a few minutes of their time they can understand the dead-lock we are in. The goal can be achieved if we can compile the hottest and latest updates on the environment from all over the internet into one space, which allows our users to digest all the information relating to the environment as much as they pleases in the shortest amount of time. A space that allows our users to discuss their thoughts and opinions about the topics, a space for sharing and educating one another, a space that allows our user to form activities together to at least ease the damages.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Our final goal is to construct the CycleIT that we envisioned is to develop a strong marketplace for our eco-friendly products. We understand that not everyone has the time to go out and clean beaches, plant trees, or clean the oceans. Truth to be told, only the most die hard environmentalist will be able to participate in it. The reality is that many people would love to contribute, however, they may lack the time or wouldn’t understand what they can do to do so. So, allow us to assist them in doing so. Developing a good e-commercial page with quality eco-friendly products opens up the opportunity for users to invest or donate to our website. Not only will these products prevent pollution but a portion of the profits will be used to take the course of action that is needed for the environment. The e-commercial page is where we allow users to take actions with a little bit of our help. At the end of the day our goal is to help take actions to heal the environment, so it is crucial that this goal is met.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            We only have three primary goals to achieve our aim. However, what we want from the website is to raise awareness towards everyone and possibly attract the user to spare a small amount of their earnings for the cause that can be used by everyone. So, our main focus currently will be on developing a formidable UI for the website to allow all our users to have a good experience on our website. Despite having a small timeframe for the project, our team will try our best to develop a UI that is easy for everybody and can run as smoothly as possible.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    <h3>Plan and Progress </h3>
                        <p>
                            To begin we would like to discuss the road map for CycleIT. CycleIT is developed as an educational, e-commercial and social media platform. The idea is to educate people from all over the world via our quick 5-minute read summarizes of the latest environmental trends in the world, allow users to discuss and create forums to build a strong environmentalist community, also including a e-commerce store that will specifically advertise and sell eco-friendly products to allow users to donate or invest into our cause of raising awareness and connecting people to protect our planet. We decided to do so by creating a website that focuses on creating a “Reference Page” where news articles are summarized and those who are interested can click on a link to read the whole article. As well as development of our e-commercial store, with products on display for users to purchase. So far, that was all we really managed to complete, which was a bit different from our vision. I guess we underestimated some of the processes it takes to develop some of the features we wanted
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            To make this project just like what we envisioned, we have to really understand the use of databases, which will allow user accounts to be created and user information to be stored. Understanding databases will also enable us to allow our users to share information or leave their comments. Developing a database will also enable us to collect information from our users such as their username, phone number, email addresses, bio, bank account information since these will be information that users will be inputting when setting up their respective profiles or when purchasing a product from our store. User’s data is not the only thing that we will be using our database for, the database can also be used to store different articles, so users can always access these 5-minute reads whenever. Understanding databases is also very useful when it comes to the management and integrity of the website, we wouldn’t want to create an environment where it is toxic for people, a database allows us to keep track of banned/blacklisted users from our website. When that is completed the next step is to develop a sort of AI to increase user’s experience on our website. The team at this stage would need to understand the operations and create a sort of AI that is similar to the Google search engine, where the user can input specific key words in the search tool and can find different 5-minute news from our database. A chatbot is a feature that is also very useful when it comes to supporting our user in providing them support with all the features of the website. For the time being AI along with databases are beyond our abilities and will take a longer timeframe than the available duration of the project, so we were unable to develop any of these ideas in our prototype. For the time being, we were able to complete the first stage in our project with the development of a satisfactory UI that is user-friendly to navigate through which allows ease of access for the general public. 
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            What we stated above were our plans for the website, however, during the 11 weeks we have there were many dead-ends that have made us alter much of our plans, as well as shifted our direction for the website. To start our team was assembled in week 1, with a team of 4 members. During that week, because of our similar tutorial sessions we were able to bond with one another via team meetings after our class times. In this time we were able to understand the personality of one another, each other’s goals and dreams in their lives, our areas of interests and dislikes… from here we were able to decide as a team the topic for our project, which was to develop a sort of social media for the environment. From here our roles were also decided, it was a mutual decision from all the members, Dung was designated as the leader, Hiep and Quan will act as operations manager and supporter. We didn’t mention our 4th member because that was our first dead-end. It was around the start of week 2 when we encountered a shocking situation, of one our members deserting us. It was an unfortunate situation, but we kept our chins up and the passion we have for protecting the environment became stronger. During that second week we reassigned our roles so the workload would fall to 3 members instead of 4. Thankfully, everyone was able to remain composed and our motivation was unchecked. Dung acted just like a leader, motivated us and quickly came up with an alternative solution for our group.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            It was in this second week that the first proposal for our project was written. The proposal was quickly written by Hiep and Quan under the leadership of Dung. Quan in this time started to research technical features of different social media such as: Facebook, Instagram, TikTok… and attempt to extract the different features that can be implemented into our website. It was during week 3 that we received the feedback for our proposal, it was not as good as we expected it to be, but we were not discouraged. Hiep and Quan were assigned to make any adjustments according to the feedback to improve the final proposal for resubmission. It was also in this time that we hit our second dead-end, was that the timetable Dung set out for us was a bit too much work load for the entire group, time management felt like a problem in our group, so the team had a meeting and changes were made to the timetable to make it suitable for everyone.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            From the start of week 4 to the end of week 5 was the period where communication in our group has weakened substantially, since our task was to just individually study primarily HTML and CSS along with JS and SQL if we were able to manage time. We set out two of these weeks to study a new language because not every member in our group was experienced in web development. If any, we can only say Dung has much understanding in HTML and CSS. It was during this time that, despite being a team, we acted as 3 individuals who just brainstormed on our own and asked each other questions if we encountered any difficulty in studying the new languages. We all become disconnected from each other in these 2 weeks. However, starting from week 6 the team was back. It was in this time that we started to come together more, Quan in this time has played his part and initiated many group meetings. It was during this time that we all came up with a design for the website, even a name for it, CycleIT. During this week, we were really acting as a team with Quan doing heavy research on the prices of products and different ways to develop the e-commercial section of CycleIT. Hiep and Dung since they are more experienced on website design were building the foundations of CycleIT, assisting one another in the different pages of the navigation tool and UI design. We thought everything was going smoothly until it was around week 8 to the end of week 9 where another hurdle had demonstrated itself. Due to respective personal reasons the group was once again inactive and not much was accomplished. Communication in the group was at an all time low, we were not holding any meetings as well as wasn’t making any improvements to the website. We understand that we have other deadlines in other courses, but not communicating with each other has caused us to overestimate the amount of time we have left, and caused us to struggle in the following weeks. As week 10 comes around the presentation wasn’t done, only small updates were made on the website, we have not started to write the report. This was a type where the group fell into chaos, we became demotivated and were scared that we might not be able to submit this assignment on time. It was during this time that Hiep took over, he substantially improved the team morale. We came together and held meetings everyday, to push to finish and practice for our presentation, finish the report as well and finish the prototype for CycleIT. We were once again motivated and productivity in the group skyrocketed. 

                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            In the end, we were able to deliver our presentation of CycleIT and we were overall satisfied with the outcome of it. Initially our aims were high and we have brainstormed many ideas for CycleIT. At the time we were high spirited and were confident in our programming abilities, however, in reality we have not considered many variables that have affected us. It was rather disappointing that we couldn’t develop the website as we envisioned, yet we were still in high spirit and thankful for the lessons that it has  taught us. We are still motivated and really want to pursue our aim of educating and acting to protect our planet, and will be delighted if we can continue to build CycleIT. This is not the end of CycleIT. If we were to pass this project on, the ideas we came up with, the motivations, the aim of this project along with our story of developing CycleIT over the last 11 weeks is something we would want our successor to know and would hope they can have the ability that we lack and the passion that we carry.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    <h3>Roles</h3>
                        <p>
                            In the creation of CycleIT we have decided on the following roles, these roles are assigned based on the abilities as well as the area of interest of each member. To begin we start with Dung, he will be our lead developer and will be the team leader. Dung is a person that assembled the team together as well as having vast knowledge of web design and web development, so it’s obvious that he will be the person the project leader. Dung is a very responsible person, as has proved himself throughout the project as a person we are willing to follow throughout. He was also the person that mapped out the roadmap for this project as well as assigning roles for everyone
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Second is Hiep, his role will be acting as content designer and UI designer. CycleIT is a project where Hiep showed much interest in, along with his creative and more playful personality, it is in his interest to design and brainstorm ideas for the website. He also understands the languages and what it takes to create an appealing website. Hiep will also act as a web tester along with Quan as we continue with web development. He will be the person coding the website and will be changing certain aspects of the website after receiving feedback from Dung. Also he allows the procedure and communication within the team to be fluent and summarize the details of every meeting. Play a major role in noting down information of meetings
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Finally we have Quan, he is a person with much passion in the project, despite knowing little about web development, he is a curious individual that was willing to learn what it takes to create a website. Quan acts as an operations manager; he sets up meetings that allow members to come together, he also plays a vital role in brainstorming ideas as well as testing the prototype of our website. Play a role in creating the presentation for the group as well as keeping up with information for everyone in the group.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <p>
                            Since every member in our group briefly understands the language that is used to code the website, all members participate in coding, each member taking a certain section in the website (e.g: Home page, Reference, About Us…). All of the code is sent back to the leader (Dung), for feedback as well as further development.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                    <h3>Scope and Limits</h3>
                        <p>For this project, the table below maps out the scope of our team for CycleIT. The table will display out certain features that during our brainstorming process we came up, whether it was mark as high in priority (which means it is something indispensable from the website) to features that are much lower in priority or beyond our limitations, and a brief description of the feature. For the sake of simplicity, duration of the project and our current ability in web development some of the features brainstormed or mentioned may be available in the future.</p>

                    <h3>Tools and Technologies</h3>
                    <p>
                        For the first step of the project,  a laptop is needed for us to have access to an IDE for us to start programming the website. Any of our computers or even the university’s computer should be efficient. For now we will use the laptop of one of our members, a Lenovo Legion with 1TB of HDD storage, Intel Core i7 10th Gen, with a NVDIA GTX 1650 GPU… this hardware should be more than enough to run some line of code for the website. Our IDE of choice will be Microsoft Visual Studio Code Version 1.74 because out of all the IDE, VS Code is the coding environment we are most comfortable with due to the fact that we have been using it for many Python projects in the past. Out of all the front-end languages we decided to code the website using HTML and CSS due to the simple nature of it allowing some of the members to learn and quickly implement some of it into the website. Both Hiep and Quan are relatively new to website development so HTML and CSS is the most suitable choice to construct our prototype. Furthermore, advanced coders like Dung (who have built many websites before in the past) can assist them in learning the language in the early stages. Basically all of the code will be written in HTML and CSS and compiled in VSCode. With the current time frame, our team is only able to learn so much and still lack  much experience with other languages, AI projects or different operating systems.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        For further development of the website, we need to be able to expand our limitations. What we meant by this is that in order to implement features that are lower or even outside of our scope, we need to be able to understand different languages. We need to study more front-end and back-end languages, such as JavaScript, Java, MySQL, AWS, NodeJS… to help us build a database for our customer, database for user accounts information or even store necessary data for a potential AI. We will also need a server, with 16GB of RAM, 2TB of HDD for storage, one Intel Core I7 series process input data; to process the connection between users for the construction of our Discussion/Forum page. Furthermore, to bring our website to mobile devices we need to understand the operating systems of Apple and Linux, to be able to bring it to iOS and Android.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Testing</h3>
                    <p>
                        Just like every piece of product released to the public, the website must undergo certain testing procedures before it can be released into the public. We must carry these tests to ensure that what is output to the users is just like how we intended it to be. When testing a website, we will need to follow the following checklist: site appearance, performance of the website, and the different features that we implemented. The process will be divided into two phases of testing. The first being we will test the website amongst ourselves using our respective hardwares. At this stage, we will put the website under a different environment (different browsers and different versions of the browsers); check the overall interface of the website when we minimize or maximize; check the different functions when clicking on a textbox, links… The second being tested in a small selected group. For our “beta testers” these will be a combined group of 100 people which are friends and family of each member; no background is required since we aim to release it to the general public, we want it to be as user-friendly as possible. We will provide a link so users can interact on our website. The website will be available to the group for the duration of 2 months. During this time the user will interact with the different functions that the website offers: create an account, post comments or start a discussion, e-commerce functionality, clicking on links… and provide with many feedbacks to debug and improve the website. All data from testers will be taken in and we will discuss ways to improve the website. We will frequently update the website in this time so we can receive more feedback for the changes. If our data shows an average around a 75% in user enjoyability, the website will pass the test. We will consider broadening the amount of testers, this time the goal is to find errors pertaining to heavy traffic.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <h3>Group Processess and Communication</h3>
                    <p>
                        Communication is a crucial aspect of group projects, bad communication means working as individuals which may cause missing information, late submission, and worst-case scenario failure of the entire project. It also makes each member feel separated, this means that it will become increasingly difficult to continue to work together and may cause a form of demotivation.Without communication a group is basically a bunch of people working as individuals, not working together as a whole. People may argue that working alone and figuring out a solution may be better, but that is not always the case. Talking to our teammates and trying to find an answer together allows work to be efficient and effective. A group can cover for the weaknesses of one another, work can be managed efficiently, tasks can be completed in a shorter amount of time, and remove duplication of work… Because of that, our group always tries to keep the flow of communication between each other as fluent as possible.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <p>
                        Fortunately, each member of our team has the same tutorial schedule so basically, we have face-to-face meetings frequently around 2 to 3 times a week. Outside class times, we also sit together in the library and discuss the project after our programming class on Thursday. Sometimes we make an appointment to meet each other during the weekend. When possible we try to have offline meetings on the campus, however, that is not always possible that is when we will use other online mediums such as:
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <ul class="platform">
                        <li>1.Messenger: Facebook Messenger to contact each other, which is also extremely important because this is how we cheer each other up, remind deadlines or discuss details. Information can be quickly shared and text amongst one another.</li>
                        <li>2.Github: We also use the most common website for developers which is GitHub to share the codes that are used to build websites and edit them together. GitHub is a powerful workspace for coders because most of our work is coding and debugging so this online platform is our main communication technically</li>
                        <li>3.Discord: We decided to use Discord over Zoom or Microsoft Teams, because it is a platform we are much more familiar with, along with better streaming and sound quality. </li>
                        <li>4.Google Docs: Google Docs also stands out as a useful website for us to write this report together because we can edit it at the same time with the whole group. </li>
                    </ul>
                    <br>
                    <p>In case someone does not respond to communications, other members will temporarily do their work, and the person can edit and add details that he thinks are necessary. However, that case isn’t likely going to happen. We are a team and each of us is responsible for the project. Even when a member of the team cannot respond to communications due to network problems, etc, he will finish the work that was assigned to him previously. Else, we all have private contact information of one another. Which allows us to contact each other on a more private and personal level. When we are capable of contacting, we will ask them to communicate more with the group, or attempt to understand what are the problems that are preventing them from communicating, if so we try to do our best to resolve it together.</p>
                    <h3>Risk</h3>
                    <h4>Members</h4>
                    <p>
                        This is a group assignment, so missing a member would be a huge loss to the team. What if someone suddenly drops from the team? Unfortunately, that scenario happens to us which means the amount of work that each member has to do increases significantly. There’s absolutely no way to prevent that to happen but we will try our best to fulfill that person’s role. We also try to think of it as a positive thing because we can learn more by doing more.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Time management</h4>
                    <p>
                        Time management is a crucial skill not only in group projects but also in any aspect of personal life. If we fail to manage our time properly, it may lead to many consequences such as being unable to finish the project on time or being forced to change our topic to something easier. We are well aware of it and we are still training the skill gradually. However, in case something unwantedly happens and one of us just cannot have time to do his work, other members are more than welcome to share the work together. We don’t see this project as a group project but as an independent project. That way, we don’t rely on each other and all of us always try our best to accomplish the goal.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Technical problems</h4>
                    <p>
                        There are always technical problems when we do IT projects such as internet issues or computers suddenly shut down. In the past, we all encountered those problems so we understand thoroughly how serious they are. Our goal is to develop a website, and fortunately, it doesn’t require any internet connection. We can program even without access to the internet.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Product Sources</h4>
                    <p>Last but not least, one of our website’s objectives is to sell items that are friendly to the environment so finding a stable source of products with a reasonable price that still satisfies the quality that our website needs is such a challenge. There’s a risk that we may not find the source to buy the products that we want to sell. In that case, one member of our team has a friend who actually sells this kind of item, so we can buy products from him. Additionally, we will not make a profit out of our products since we prioritize raising people’s awareness of protecting the environment.</p>
